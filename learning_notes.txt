-- Components:
	- Input and output singals.
		- port (a,b: in bit, c: out bit);
	- Parameters: Using "GENERICS" statement. EX: GENERIC pr: time := 2 ns); 
	- Global definitions for all architectures.

* =============================== *
-- Architecture: What does the module do? 
-- Could be: Behavioral or structural description.
-- Ex:
architecture behav1 of entity1 is
begin
-- Descript the behavior here.
end behav1;

* =============================== *
-- Configuration: Which architecture version and which subcomnponents are used?




* =============================== *
Structural:
	1. Instantiate sub-components.
	2. Interconnections of sub-components.
Behavioral:
	1. Concurrent/parallel statements.
	2. Sequential statements.
